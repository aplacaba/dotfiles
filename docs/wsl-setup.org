   Available on MS Store for $49.99. You can wait for sale, I got mine for as low as $9.99.
   But if you prefer a free tool, you can check out [[https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/][vcxsrv]].

   For usage, it doesn't really get in your way just install and setup permissions and you're good to go.
** Executables
